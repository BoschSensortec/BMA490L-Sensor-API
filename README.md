# BMA490L Sensor API - Bosch Sensortec

> This package contains Bosch Sensortec's BMA490L accelerometer sensor API

## Sensor Overview
The BMA490L is an ultra-small, triaxial, low-g acceleration sensor with digital interfaces, aiming for low-power consumer electronics applications.
Featuring 16 bit digital resolution and embedded intelligence, the BMA490L allows low-noise measurement of accelerations in 3 perpendicular axes and thus 
senses any-motion and no-motion. Furthermore the device is optimized to fulfill Android M low power accelerometer requirements.
